          Peacefy has held over half a billion Al chat conversations with more
          than five million people about their mental health. The worrying trend
          we saw in employee mental health led us to conduct in-depth studies of
          employees in India, as well as Peacefy's user base, to understand why
          current models aren't working.

        <div class="our-findings-make">
          Our findings make a compelling case for employers to create early,
          anonymous, unlimited care and show how starting with Peacefy's
          conversational Al actually saves on the total cost of care.
